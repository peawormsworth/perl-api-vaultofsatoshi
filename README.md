perl-api-vaultofsatoshi
=======================

Perl module for VaultofSatoshi API

These perl modules have not been extensively tested. Please use with caution.

There is no documentation (pods) yet. But the test.pl file should get you started.

In order to get this to work, you need to put it all in a directory named 'VaultofSatoshi'. My appologizes for not figuring out the directory structure.

A proper Perl module will be coming for CPAN that will allow you to 'make; make test; make install'.
